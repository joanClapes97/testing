We work locally here and we have a repository on our githb account.
Now, clone the repository on the same directory as here, /Joan.
We work on this file/project, but also New_employee works on that from another
folder which can be in any computer. Let's do it (we are Joan)
Use Git Bash on Windows
Once cloned, put our files inside the repository we cloned.

# NOTE: the repository contains a hided directory, .git, which allows
us to communicate with it
